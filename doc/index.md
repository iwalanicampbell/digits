### Installation 

First, install Meteor.

Second, download a copy of Digits. Note that Digits is a private repo and so you will need to request permission from the author to gain access to the repo.

Third, cd into the app directory install the required libraries with:

```$ meteor npm install```

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking:

```$ meteor npm run start```

When you first run the app in the terminal there will be lots of words, it just means that the app is creating defualt users and data.  If all goes well, the template application will appear at http://localhost:3000. You can login using the credentials in settings.development.json, or else register a new account.
